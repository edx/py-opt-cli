# Overview
py-opt-cli is a CLI (command-line interface) tool that can retrieve experiments, pages, etc. from 
[optimizely](https://app.optimizely.com). 

It is a thin wrapper around optimizely's [REST API](https://developers.optimizely.com/x/rest/v2/) that helps organize 
files in a consistent fashion.
